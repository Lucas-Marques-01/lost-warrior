# Lost Warrior - Text Adventure Game

This is my first Python project, created to practice basic programming concepts focused on terminal interaction.

I designed a simple adventure where you can **choose different paths and actions** that directly affect the flow of the story and its outcomes.

I used **ASCII art** to make the experience more visual and fun, bringing scenes to life even in text mode.

In this game, you'll face **unexpected encounters, monsters, and survival challenges**, all through keyboard input.

### Personal challenges I faced:
- Understanding and implementing multi-choice logic in the code.
- Handling user inputs to avoid errors and keep the game flowing smoothly.

### What I learned and solved:
- Developed a clear if-else structure and ensured inputs are processed with `.strip().lower()`.
- Used ASCII art to enrich the terminal and make the game more enjoyable.

### Next steps I plan for this project:
- Modularizing the code by breaking it into functions for easier maintenance and expansion.
- Adding inventory and items to make the game more interesting.
- Creating loops to allow playing multiple times without restarting the program.

This project marks my first step into Python development and it's open for continuous improvements!
